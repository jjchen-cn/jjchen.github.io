                <strong>Research on Voice Enhancement Methods Based on Asynchronous Acoustic Sensor Networks</strong><br>
                <em>Advisor: Prof. Jie Zhang, USTC</em><br>
                <em>Oct 2024 - Jun 2025 (Expected)</em><br>
                - Objective: Developing a program to address asynchronous issues in voice enhancement.<br>
                - Approach: Simulated a room environment by arbitrarily positioning two microphones and placing a sound source at an equal distance from both microphones. Introduced noise and conducted audio transmission and reception. Performed resampling on one microphone channel to simulate an asynchronous signal scenario.<br>
                - Utilized the frequency domain properties of audio STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) to train and implement an LSTM network for synchronization, ensuring both microphone channels achieved the same sampling rate.<br>
                - Trained FaSNet/McNet as a speech enhancement module to process and enhance the signals from both microphones.<br>
                - Compared the quality of the ideal signal, asynchronous signal, and network-processed signal to evaluate the performance of the network.<br>
                - Innovation: The innovative aspect of my approach involves using deep learning combined with mathematical tools to replace traditional, complex, and inefficient mathematical calculations.
